1.  **Engineering & C++ Best Practices**: If I ask for something that isn't considered good engineering practice or good C++ practice (e.g., testing private methods, breaking encapsulation, unsafe memory usage), **let me know before making the changes**. Explain why it's a bad idea and propose a better alternative.
